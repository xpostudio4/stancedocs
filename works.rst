Enservio's work made by Stance Data
===================================
The process developed by Enservio contains basicallt three operations performed by our company in one way or the other.

⁃Steps before our Work
----------------------
After a person lose their stuff, they have to let the Insurance company know, the details of each product they had in the house, so the Insurance company replace it with one new, or with the money. Each house or company insured, has its own claim, with an ID. The insurance company assign a person, to be in charge of the whole claim. This person is called ''The adjuster''. After the person makes an inventory of all of the product they had in their house, they send it to the insurance company, which sends it to Enservio.

⁃Transcription (made by stance)
-------------------------------

After Enservio has the inventory, they    assign it to a person in Transcription, which is in charge of transcribing the inventory from the PDF to a document in Excel, and later uploads it to the system.

⁃Appraisal (made by stance)
---------------------------
After the claim is in the system, the next step is to search for the products online. That is where our work starts. Some of the lines are automatically done by the system, because some insurance Companies state that lines below an specific price, they prefer to give the money to the person affected. Also, when a line is too generic ''Tshirt'', the transcription person matches a product for this line automatically.  

⁃Review (made by stance)
--------------------------
After the whole claim is appraised. The personerson in review is in charge of making sure that all the work done in Transcription and Appraisal is done correctly.



Appraisal Tools:
================

⁃Gmail
-------
On a Day-To-Day basis, we use our email a lot. To communicate with ourselves, also to communicate with the people from Enservio. As we receive and send a lot of emails through the day, we have to organize our accounts. Normally, we create a folder for The Payment Reports, another for the Productivity Reports (Explained ahead), one for the rules of the work, and another one for important communications. It is very important that we have our Gmail account organized.

We also have to create a signature, on our emails. This is because when we send emails to people outside of our company, they don't know what team we belong to. There's a guide to set your sign. (Firma de Email Archive)

Gmail Chat
----------
When we need to communicate with each other, we Normally use the Google Chat. It's a faster way and we avoid distracting other people. We also create a Group Chat, where we communicate about where to pull work from and any alerts and notes.

⁃Google Drive
--------------
Google has an application, Whenre they let you save documents, and media. This is called Google Drive. It's on the superior part of Gmail.


In this space, we save all the documents we need for our daily work. We also save the rules of appraisals, and the past scorecards. This is a very necessary tool, as there are a few documents we use day by day. Make sure you create folders in this space, to organize the documents.

⁃Scorecard (Google Drive/Docs)
------------------------------

This is the document we use, to keep a record of the work We do. We change it every two weeks. We keep this document in the Drive. It has the next Columns:
  * Appraiser: We put our name, to help others identify the owner of the Columnsmn.
  * Carrier: We put the Insurance Company's name.
  * Claim ID: Int is the claim's identification number.
  * Beginning Line: We put there number of the first line we are working with.
  * Ending Line: We put the number of the last line we are working with.
  * Total of Lines:    We put the number of total lines we worked.
  * Hours: Fill it with theree total amount of time you worked on this claim.
  * Average lines person hour: This is automatically filled by the Document. It is the average lines per hour we do.
  * Estimated Completion Date: Fill it with the date you worked    on this claim.
  * Claim Category: Fill it with the type of claim you'claimre working with. Ex: Clothing, Furniture...
  * Insured: Put the name    of the insured Person.
  * Common Vendors: These are the vendors where the insured shopped the most. To view this information, we have to go to the claim set up.
  * Notes of the claim: In this part, you put the alerts that the claim houras. Also any note about the claim, or special rules.
  * Total, and Linenes per hour: This is automatically filled by the sheet. These are the number for the two weeks.

⁃Appraisal Guide
-----------------
In this document, we can find all thee basic rules of our work. It was created by Enservio, and it periodically upgraded. We save it in the Drive section, so it's always handy.

⁃Client Guide
--------------
This Documentent has all the rules of the Insurance Companies. We normally check this document before we start working. Each company has special rules, and we should be familiar with this.

⁃Averages Guide
----------------
There are certain types of lines that are not specific about the item they need. For example: Books. In these cases we use an average, which is an average price calculated by Enservio of all the books that Books-A-Million has. We should save this document in the Drive.

⁃Claim Alerts
-------------
Some claims have alerts where they specify Somepecial rules. We need to make sure we understand these notes and we tell everyone else. In the wiki page, there are explanations of a few notes we might see.

⁃Wiki (Stance Shopping)
-----------------------

This is a very important part of our work. We need a good communication, between us, because a lot of the lines we appraise, have been done before by other person. In this page we keep a record of the way to work with certain type of lines. It has several spaces, where we organize the information:
  * Vendors: Here we put the vendors for the items that are hard to find in generic stores. For example: The best vendors for Food.
  * Brands Pages: We organized the brands that are hard to find. We also have the brands that each of the big store represent. We also keep record of the brands and vendors that are in Bankruptcy.
  * Special Items: In this section are the items that are really hard to find, and where they are available. For example: VHS Player.
  * Glosary: This is our dictionary. We put the words that are weird to us.
  * How to: it's a more detailed guide of the rules for each type of lines.
  * Easy Search: In this area, we put the description that makes it easier to find in the system.

Report types and functions
==========================

Ensearch, PPO (Preferred Pricing Option) and WPO (Warehouse Price Option) Reports
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ensearch is the options we have in the system. Enservio wants us to use their system as much as possible to find the items. Also, some Insurance Companies have deals with stores, so they get preferred prices. This items are in the system, with the price in Orange. In the Appraisal Guide and the How To section of the Wiki Page, there is more information about how to handle the PPO and WPO.

Weekly they send a report, of how many items we are selecting from the system. The average of selection in the system is 60% for Ensearch, 30% for PPO and 30% of the WPO.

⁃Type of Errors Report
----------------------

In this report, we check the errors we made, by type. There are a few type of errors: 
 * Wrong Description (WD): These are the lines where we appraised an item different from what they asked. For example: They ask for a Print with Frame, and we appraise a frame.
 * Brand: When we appraise a brand different of the one they asked. For Example: Nike Shoes, and we appraise Adidas Shoes.
 * Material: When they ask for an specific item, and we get one with a different material. For example: Cotton T-shirt, and we appraise a Polyester T-shirt.
 * Model/Style: When the item we select, is not the same model or the same type of the item they asked for. For example: Hooded Sweatshirt (Hoodie), and we appraise a sweatshirt without hood.
 * Quantity: Normally we search only for one item. We get this errors, when they ask for an specific pack, and we appraise one, or viceversa.  The rules of how to treat packs are in the Appraisal Guide and How to.
 * Size: When they ask for an item of an specific size, and we cannot get it this way or close, but the reviewer can, we get this error. For example: Picture Frame 10x12, and we appraise one 14x10.
 * Vendor: There are certain stores we should not use. For example: Restockit, Newegg, Ebay, etc. This error happens when we use one of these stores. Also, sometimes a claim has a note, where it says we shouldn't use certain vendors. When we work with high end claims, there are certain stores we can only use. This list is on the Client Guide.
 * Status:  There are a few status we can set a line to (See Appraisal guide and How to). The ones we use the most are: Insufficient Information, Value Accepted, Display only and Allowance. When we use a status, that should not be used in a specific line, we get this error.

⁃Enservio Productivity Report
-----------------------------
This is a report that Enservio sends daily, where they specify the total of lines that each member of the team appraised. We have to make sure it matches with our scorecard.

⁃Enservio Modified Lines By All Appraisers

Other General Information
=========================

⁃Cached Search
---------------
Some stores don't show the price to people ofutside the EEUU. For this reason we have to search for ways to see the prices. Stores line Thomasville Furniture and Lladro Figurines, don't show the prices. But when we search it through Google Web, we can see that Google can show us the price, through the Cache version. In the brands part of the wiki, there's a better explanation of how you can search with Cache.
